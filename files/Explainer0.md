# Explainer0

Your job is to write a shortish notebook explaining your chosen concept(s). Communicate the concepts as best as you can.

## Getting started

* Go to [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
* Open new notebook
* Name it FirstnameExplainer0 (where Firstname is replaced with your actual first name)
* Share the notebook with me (nolan.donoghue@viewpoint.org)
* Make cells!
* Go [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1awLouuDE-XDkYRHT69ozHj8lRuM0eABy6o3XpLtnatI/edit?usp=sharing) and choose a lil topic. Talk to me if you'd like a topic that isn't listed.

## Tips
* Your notebook should NOT be just code cells
* You are encouraged to use chatgpt to help write your explainer. Make sure you save the chats you use to show me.
* Extra cool if your notebook contains questions a learner could attempt to answer
